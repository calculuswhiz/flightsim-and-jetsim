Note that this was just a rough draft for brainstorming. Ideas in this file have evolved a lot.

Objects:
    Plane:
        Properties:
            air density (height dependent)
            mass (intrinsic)
            perspective (intrinsic)
            Forces:
                weight (from mass)
                lift (wing tilt vs speed)
                drag (air density, wing angle)
                thrust (fuel, controllable)
            g-force - may cause perspective distortion/death (realism! yay!)
                -3 or lower = redout after a couple seconds (more = die), recover if come back. I don't know exactly how long it is, so let's say it's the same as blackout.
                6 or higher = blackout after a couple seconds, recover if come back.
                    Total = 12 second recovery
                    Partial = 15 second recovery
                25 = die
            side-g-force - 20g 10 sec, 10g 1 min, 6g for 10 min, etc.
            Newtonian:
                r(t), v(t), a(t) (Vectors: <i,j,k>) each with magnitudes.
                momentum (mass and velocity)
                KE (same)
            fuel:
                Also has mass (run out = no more thrust)
                Rate depends on speed
            wing tilts (controlled):
                has a range of motion
            HUD:
                displays relevant data, warnings
            rotational: depends on wing tilts
                Pitch (x axis)
                Roll (y axis)
                Yaw (z axis) ? Will I need this?
                rotational momentum
        Control:
            thruster output up/down - k/j
                Fuel consumption goes up to a max amount.
            wing tilts - arrow keys:
                up - angle up both (pitch down)
                down - angle down both (pitch up)
                left - up left, down right (roll left)
                right - down left, up right (roll right)
                Will return naturally. Tends down a bit to keep flight stable.

Simulation terminates on:
    Fall below sea level
    Die from g-force
    Out of bounds? Or just wrap around.
    Quit (escape)

Formulas:
    Fuel consumed at x L/s. (Adjustible) Energy rating of y kJ/L.
    P = x*y kJ/s.
        P*t = 1/2*m*v^2 so...
    v = sqrt(2*P*t/m)
    a = dv/dt (sampled)
    d = v*t
    Lift = .5 * \rho * v^2 * A * C_L
        rho = p*M/R/T
            p = p_0*(1-L*height/288.15)^(g*T_0/R/L)
                p_0 = 101325
                L = .0065
                g = 9.80665
                T_0 = 288.15
                R = 8.31447
            M = .0289644
            T = T_0 - L*height
        v = speed of plane
        A = some constant area of wing
        C_L from this graph:  Maybe assume .5
            http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_coefficient#mediaviewer/File:Lift_curve.svg
    Weight = m*g
    Thrust = m*a
    Drag = .5 * rho * v^2 * C_D * A
        See wikipedia for C_D
